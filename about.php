					<h2>Enchanter Pumat Prime</h2>
					<p class="title">Primary Craftsman and Proprietor</p>
					<p>Since I opened the Invulnerable vagrant 20 years ago I have been making wares to sell in the
						great city of Zadash. In recent years I’ve been spending less and less time behind the counter
						myself and more time perfecting my craft, but the other Pumats have been more than capable of
						handling the front. I would respectfully ask that you only come to me when you want to
						commission a specific item and are willing to pay the additional labor costs that entails.</p>

					<p class="title">Craftsman and Store Hand</p>
					<p>Since I came into existence 20 years ago, I’ve been acting as an extra pair of hands to the other
						Pumats. I assist in difficult or simply large crafting projects and with the store during the
						busy periods. I specialize in managing our supply chain to ensure that Pumat Prime always has
						all of the materials he needs to conduct his work. You can contact me with offers on raw
						materials.</p>
