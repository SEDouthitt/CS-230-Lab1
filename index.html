<!--For the record, I have only the faintest idea what I am doing. I have never coded in html before. (Though evidently this isn't code? What is it then!) I have never even seen the backend code of a web page. 
I don't understand how this is read or executed or what all of the "<div>" parts are actually doing and I didn't initially know what you meant by directories. I was so lost on the initial lecture that I didn't 
even know enough to ask questions about what I didn't understand. It would've just been "what on earth are you doing." I've never even had an interest in web design. You spent a lot of time talking about things 
we'll use later in the semester and that just made it harder to understand what was and was not important to completeing this task. I'd also like to point out that you said you would be using Sublime and then 
spent most of the video looking at Visual Studio Code. You included reference pages that explain different functions, but I don't understand how to use them in the context of this format. Look, I understand that a lot of the people who go into this already have a background working with this kind of thing, but I just don't. I want to learn, 
and I'm alright with teaching myself things, but that takes a lot of time. Can you please meet me on my level? The only thing I understood enough to do even after rewatching the video was to mostly just copy 
your code and make enough changes for the page to look different. I HATE that. I like to understand what I'm doing, and when I don't I second guess everything. I'll end up spending 7 hours on something that 
should've taken 1 in a week where I can't afford to be wasting time like that.)

					<h2>Enchanter Pumat Prime</h2>
					<p class="title">Primary Craftsman and Proprietor</p>
					<p>Since I opened the Invulnerable vagrant 20 years ago I have been making wares to sell in the great city of Zadash. In recent years I’ve been spending less and less time behind the counter myself and more time perfecting my craft, but the other Pumats have been more than capable of handling the front. I would respectfully ask that you only come to me when you want to commission a specific item and are willing to pay the additional labor costs that entails.</p>
